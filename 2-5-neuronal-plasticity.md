## Introduction to Plasticity

- **Key words**: neuroplasticity
- Neuronal circuits are always changing to adapt to the environment.
- Neuronal circuits can undergo neuronal plasticity at various levels, from a single synapse to the whole network, from moment-to-moment modifications to changes that will last a lifetime.
- In a neuroscientific context, plasticity is an umbrella term that refers to changes in neuronal pathways and synapses.
- Neural plasticity can occur as a response to injury and changes in our environment and behavior.

## Short-Term Plasticity and Adaptation

- **Key words**: short-term plasticity, synaptic enhnacement, synaptic facilitation, synaptic depression/fatigue, synaptic adaptation. 
- Scale of short-term plasticity: 1ms
- Scale of long-term plasticity: from minutes to hours or more
- **Short-term synaptic enhancement**: Short-term synaptic enhancement results from an increased probability of presynaptic terminals releasing transmitters in response to pre-synaptic action potentials.
- **Short-term synaptic facilitation**: Increased excitatory post-synaptic potential facilitates postsynpatic action potentials.
- **Short-term synaptic depression [synpatic fatigue]**: This is caused by the depletion of readily releasable neurotransmitter vesicles. It can also happen from post-synaptic processes
and from feedback activation of pre-synaptic receptors.
- **Synaptic adaptation**:
  - It usually happens in sensors.
  - Adaptation mechanisms often operate on relative short time scale
  - Adaptation helps the brain be ready to process important new information.
- **Key questions**:
  - What is another name for short-term synaptic strengthening? How does it work?
    - Short-term synaptic facilitation. Higher postsynaptic potentials.
  - What is another name for short-term synaptic weakening? How does it work?
    - Short-term synaptic depression. 
  - What does "synaptic adaptation" mean? Is short-term plasticity the only mechanism of synaptic adaptation?
    - Meaning above. I am not sure whether it is the only way.

## LTP and LTD

- **Key words**: long-term plasticity, long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD).
- We need to have mechanisms that can alter synapses in a stable way that lasts for a long time. -> LTP and LTD
- LTP: long-term potentiation
  - Making synapses stronger
  - When they strongly stimulated a presynaptic fiber resulting in a strong burst of action potentials, the effect of subsequent stimulation of those same fibers on the postsynaptic neuron was potentiated, or strengthened.
- LTD: long-term depression
  - Making synapses weaker
  - If the fibers were stimulated at a low, infrequent level, the synaptic strength would gradually decrease.
- Regions of LTP and LTD
  - The cerebral cortex, cerebellum, amygdala, and many others.
  - Some scientists have suggested that LTP may indeed occur at every excitatory synapse everywhere in the mammalian brain.
- **Key questions**:
  - What do "LTP" and "LTD" mean?
    - LTP: long-term potentiation
    - LTD: long-term depression
  - LTP and LTD were first described in the hippocampus of rabbits. How did the scientists cause LTP / LTD?
    - LTP: They stimulated presynaptic fibers at a high, frequent level.
    - LTD: They stimulated presynaptic fibers at a low, infrequent level.
  - Are LTP and LTD only present in the hippocampus?
    - No, they happen in various regions in the brain.

## Hebb's Rule and Associative Learning

- **Key words**: Hebb's rule / Hebbian Theory / Hebb's Postulate / cell assembly theory, associative learning, classical conditioning.
- Network-level principle
- "Neurons that fire together, wire together."
- "Neurons out of sync lose their link."
- Co-occurence -> strengthened connection -> associative learning
- **Classical conditioning**
  - Co-occurence of bell and food -> strengthened connection of bell and food -> associative behavior  (salivation) between the two concepts
  - Pairing the sound of a bell with the taste of food in dogs could elicit salivation in the dogs.
- The connection between Hebbian theory, long term potentiation, and the molecular clockwork of the NMDA channel is one of those wonderful cases in neuroscience where theory, physiology, and molecular biology all intersect to form a deeper picture of how the nervous system works.
- **Key questions**:
  - Complete this statement: "Cells that fire together………… neurons out of sync…………"
    - Cells that fire together, wire together.
    - Neurons out of sync lose their link.
  - What is classical conditioning?
    - See above.
  - How can Hebb's rule explain classical conditioning?
    - See above.

## LTP in Depth

- **Key words**: NMDA-dependent LTP, Hebbian LTP, Non-Hebbian LTP
- Stronger synapse: More transmitters released, more postsynaptic receptors, more effective postsynaptic receptors.
- **Hebbian LTP**:
  - LTP that follows the rule "fire together, wire together".
  - NMDA receptor-dependent LTP:
- **Non-Hebbian LTP**:
  - **Anti-Hebbian LTP**
    - LTP that follows the rule "fire together, connection weakens".
    - When the pre-synaptic post-synaptic neurons fire together, the synapse tends to weaken.
- The diversity of LTP play an important role in supporting the diversity of learning and computation performed by the brain.
- **NMDA receptor-dependent LTP**:
  - A canonical example of Hebbian LTP.
  - This explains how Hebbian plasticity can be implemented.
  - Both glutamate and glycine must bind to the channel to open an NMDA receptor.
  - The NMDA receptor is both ligand-gated and voltage-gated.
    - Ligand-gated: Need for presynaptic depolarization -> ligand from neurotransmitter. The NMDA channel requires glutamate and glycine to open it.
    - Voltage-gated: Need for postsynaptic depolarization. When the neuron is depolarize, the magnesium blockade is repelled.
    - AMPA allows for Na+ and K+, not for Ca2+.
    - NMDA allows for Ca2+ as well as Na+ and K+.
    - Ca2+ is important for signaling within neurons mainly through the action of an enzyme called CAMK2.
    - AMPA receptor **phosphorylation** allows the receptor to be more sensitive than normal after LTP has taken place.
    - Ca2+ influx triggers another cellular mechanism that switches on further production and speeding up of the **trafficking** of new AMPA receptors, which leads the insertion of new AMPA receptors into the post-synaptic membrane of the synapse.
- Properties of NMDA receptor-dependent LTP
  - **Synapse specificity**: LTP at one synapse largely does not spread to other synapses.
  - **Associativity**: When weak stimulation of a single input is insufficient for the induction of LTP, simultaneous strong stimulation of another input may induce LTP at both inputs.
  - **Cooperativity**: Collective action of AMPA receptors at many synapses depolarize the cell, enabling NMDA receptors at many sites to be activated.
  - **Persistence**: LTP can last for minutes to hours to months, or even longer.
- **Key questions**:
  - What does David mean, when he mentions "Hebbian" and "non-Hebbian" mechanisms of LTP? Which category is the most prevalent in the nervous system? Which category does NMDA-dependent LTP fall into?
    - Hebbian mechanisms of LTP: See above.
    - Non-Hebbian mechanisms of LTP:See above.
  - NMDA is an ionotropic receptor. What type(s) of ions is it selective to?
    - Ca2+ (not allowed by AMPA) as well as Na+ and K+.
  - NMDA receptors are sometimes described as "**coincidence detectors**" because they open only if two synaptic events happen at the same time. What are these two events? How does this relate to Hebb's rule?
    - Two events: Presynaptic depolarization (neurotransmitter release), postsynaptic depolarization.
    - The relation to Hebb's rule: The coincidence of the two neurons' depolarization makes theri synapse stronger.
  - Among other ions, NMDA receptors let calcium flow into the postsynaptic neuron when they open. Why is it important for LTP to occur?
    - Ca2+ influx triggers another cellular mechanism that switches on further production and speeding up of the **trafficking** of new AMPA receptors, which leads the insertion of new AMPA receptors into the post-synaptic membrane of the synapse.

## LTD in Depth

- **Key words**: LTD (long-term depression), Hebbian LTD, Non-Hebbian LTD, 
- LTD produces changes in synaptic efficacy that can last for hours or longer.
- **Hebbian LTD**
  - It's usually induced by a long period of weak simulation of the presynaptic neuron that's uncorrelated with post-synaptic firing.
- **Non-Hebbian LTD**
  - **Heterosynaptic LTD**: Neuromodulatory inputs can tell the cell to weaken certain synapses.
- LTD varies depending upon brain regions and developmental stages.
- LTD in brain regions
  - LTD in the hippocampus and cerebellum are the best understood.
  - **Cerebellum LTD**: LTD caused by strong synaptic stimulation.
  - **Hippocampus LTD**: LTD caused by persistent weak synaptic stimulation.
  - In both areas, LTD is thought to result mainly from **decrease in the postsynaptic receptor density**. In other words, the removal of receptor molecules from the postsynaptic membrane renders them less able to react to neurotransmitters that are being released presynaptically.
- **Glutamate** is the most common neurotransmitter involved in LTD.
- **Key questions**:
  - Do all types of LTD follow Hebb's rule?
    - No.
  - Where does LTD occur in the brain? Is LTD induced in all these regions through the same mechanisms?
    - Hippocampus, cerebellum.
  - What molecular changes take place at the synapse during LTD?
  - How does calcium play a crucial role in LTD? Why is it puzzling?

## Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity

- **Key words**: STDP (Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity), LTP, LTD.
- **STDP (Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity)**
  - STDP exists to reinforce causal firing relationships.
- Backpropagating postsynaptic potential may contribute to reinforcing synaptic strength.
- **Key questions**:
  - What's the optimal delay between pre- and postsynaptic pulses to induce LTP / LTD?
    - LTP: Postsynaptic spikes right after presynaptic spikes.
    - LTD: Postsynaptic spikes right before presynaptic spikes.
  - Why is spike timing dependent plasticity advantageous for the brain?
    - STDP can reinforce causal firing relationships.

## Nonsynaptic Plasticity

- **Key words**: homeostatic mechanism.
- They can occur in the soma, axons and dendrites of a neuron and typically involve modification of ion channel function at these sites.
- Since these functional changes are not locally restricted to synapses, the overall integration of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, and consequently its intrinsic excitability, are affected.
- These mechanisms keep the excitability of the neuron within some desirable range and are sometimes called "**homeostatic**" mechanisms.
- **Key questions**:
  - Where in neurons does nonsynaptic plasticity occur? What neuronal changes does it involve?
    - Nonsynaptic plasticity involves modification of ion channel function at nonsynaptic sites.
  - Scientists sometimes use the term "homeostatic mechanism" to talk about nonsynaptic plasticity processes. Why?
    - Neurons serve to keep the excitability of the neuron in some desirable operating range.

## Lesson 5: Conclusion

So where does this leave us? Well, like so many processes in neurobiology we have already encountered or will still encounter in later lessons, research on synaptic plasticity and its associated processes is still in its infancy.

Much research remains to be done. While the molecular and cellular mechanisms of long-term potentiation and depression have been relatively well characterized in select parts of the brain, **the much larger implications of these mechanisms on the overarching cognitive and behavioral mechanisms remain to be uncovered**.

Determining these relationships currently are major focuses of synaptic plasticity researchers throughout the world not only to understand how our brain works, but with the hope of ultimately being able to develop novel medicine for disorders that are affected by impairments of LTP or LTD and its associated processes.
