## What is Neuromodulation?

- **Neuromodulation** is the process by which the synaptic transmission between two neurons is either **enhanced or decreased** through the action of a third substance called neuromodulator.
- **Objectives**:
  - Discuss in detail the mechanisms of neuromodulation.
  - Explore the major **neuromodulatory circuits** found in the brain.
- Neuromodulatory neurons
- Mechanism
  - Locally: Effects on a group of local neurons.
  - Systemically: Most neuromodulators act through G-protein-coupled receptors, or GPCRs.

## Processes of Neuromodulation

- **Key words**: neuromodulation, structural change, non-structural change, synaptic efficacy.
- What makes neuromodulation different from synaptic transmission?
- Structural
  - Structural changes occur at the end of life as a part of normal aging and when things go wrong, as in the case of certain neuro-degenerative disorders like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.
- Non-structural
  - **Efficacy**
  - The vast majority of these changes in synaptic strength during the human lifespan
  - Presynaptic neuron: Altering the amount of neurotransmitters.
  - Postsynaptic neuron: Altering the response to neurotransmitters
- **Key questions**:
  - Which part(s) of the synapse can release neuromodulators?
  - Which aspect(s) of synaptic transmission is (are) modified by neuromodulation?
  - Which synaptic compartment(s) undergo changes during neuromodulation?

## Ionotropic Receptors

- **Key words**: ionotropic receptor, metabotropic receptor, intracellular signaling cascades, second messenger molecule
- Two types of postsynaptic receptors
  - Ionotropic receptor
    - Speed: Fast: 1ms scale
    - Structure: Ligand-gated ion channels
    - Pore. Ion channels.
  - Metabotropic receptor
    - Speed: Slow: 1ms
    - Structure: 
    - Not ion channel.
    - Activation of **intracellular signaling cascades** through **second messenger molecules**.
    - In this process, proteins are to be produced.
    - induce changes in the electrical and biochemical properties of postsynaptic neurons.
- Many of the classic fast-acting ionotropic neurotransmitters, as we'll see shortly, can also act as neuromodulators through metabotropic receptors, both presynaptically and postsynaptically.
- As such, a single neurotransmitter release can act almost immediately, while also having slow, long-lasting actions on the time scale of seconds to minutes, sometimes even weeks.
- These intricate, nested interactions over many time scales add additional layers of complexity to neuronal signaling.
- This complexity plays a critical role in enabling the nervous system to change and adapt over different time scales.
- **Key questions**:
  - What is the main difference between ionotropic and metabotropic receptors?
    - I: ion channel, fast (1ms-scale)
    - M: intracellular signaling cascade, second messenger molecule, 
  - How does neuromodulation blur this distinction?
    - Many of the classic fast-acting ionotropic neurotransmitters can also act as neuromodulators through metabotropic receptors, both presynaptically and postsynaptically. As such, a single neurotransmitter release can act almost immediately, while also having slow, long-lasting actions on the time scale of seconds to minutes, sometimes even weeks. These intricate, nested interactions over many time scales **blur** neuronal signaling.

## Metabotropic Receptors

- **Key words**: GPCR (G protein-coupled receptor), G protein.
- **GPCR (G protein-coupled receptor)**
  - A family of receptors.
  - There are over 2,000 GPCR genes in the human genome. Each type has a different preference for binding different neurotransmitters, hormones, or other types of small molecules.
  - About 10% of all genes in the human genome, all coding for GPCRs.
  - GPCRs are actually a remarkably similar class of objects.
  - A protein located in the membrane.
  - A transmembrane protein complex.
  - The G protein coupled receptor gets its name from what happens inside the cell.
  - The intracellular part of the GPCR binds a set of three proteins labeled alpha, beta, and gamma.
  - G proteins bind the molecule guanosine triphosphate or GTP. GTP is one of the four building blocks of DNA.
  - GTP serves as the raw material for DNA and RNA synthesis, acts as an energy storage molecule and plays an important role in intracellular signaling.
  - the most common type of metabotropic receptors
  - GPCRs recognize a wide variety of signals ranging from photons to ions, proteins, neurotransmitters, and hormones.
  - Not all GPCRs are metabotropic receptors.
- **GPCR activation**
  1. **Ligand Binding**: The process begins when a ligand, such as a neurotransmitter, hormone, or drug, binds to the metabotropic receptor on the neuron's cell membrane. Unlike ionotropic receptors, metabotropic receptors do not form an ion channel pore.
  1. **Receptor Activation**: Ligand binding causes a conformational change in the receptor. This change is transmitted to the intracellular side of the receptor, activating it.
  1. **G Protein Activation**: Most metabotropic receptors are coupled with G proteins (guanine nucleotide-binding proteins). The activated receptor acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP on the G protein, thus activating the G protein.
  1. **Dissociation of G Protein Subunits**: The activated G protein, which is composed of three subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma), then undergoes a conformational change. This change causes the G protein to dissociate into two parts: the **GTP-bound alpha subunit** and the **beta-gamma dimer**.
  1. **Activation of Effector Enzymes or Ion Channels**: The dissociated subunits can interact with and regulate various effector proteins in the cell. Common effectors include **effector enzymes** like adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C, or ion channels. The choice of effector depends on the type of G protein and metabotropic receptor.
  1. **Second Messenger Cascade**: Activation of effector enzymes leads to the production of **second messengers**, such as **cyclic AMP (cAMP)**, inositol trisphosphate (IP3), and diacylglycerol (DAG). These second messengers amplify the signal inside the cell and can lead to a variety of cellular responses.
  1. **Cellular Response**: The second messengers activate further downstream signaling pathways. This can involve the activation of protein kinases, changes in ion channel activity, alterations in gene expression, and other cellular responses. The ultimate effect can be excitatory or inhibitory and can have a prolonged impact on the neuron's function.
  - The alpha subunit can break free from the beta and gamma subunits.
  1. **Termination**: The signal is terminated when the GTP on the G alpha subunit is hydrolyzed to GDP, inactivating the G protein. Additionally, mechanisms such as receptor desensitization can prevent overstimulation.
- The effects of GPCR activation
  - GPCRs can have multiple, most often opposing effects on a single target.
    - Norepinephrine induces the so-called fight or flight response.
    - Acetylcholine induces the so-called rest and digest response.
  - GPCSRs can affect multiple targets at the same time.
    - cAMP can activate or inactivate ion channels in the cell membrane, metabolites in the cytoplasm, and it can even affect gene expression in the cell's nucleus.
- **Genome**: The entire set of DNA instructions found in a cell.
- **Transmembrane protein**
  - A transmembrane protein is a type of integral membrane protein that spans the entirety of the cell membrane.
  - Many transmembrane proteins function as gateways to permit the transport of specific substances across the membrane.
- **Ligand binding**: The process where a ligand (a molecule that produces a signal by binding to a site on a target protein) attaches to receptors on the neuron's cell membrane or within the neuron itself.
- **Key questions**:
  - What does "GPCR" stand for?
    - G protein-coupled receptor
  - Are all GPCRs identical?
    - No.
  - What are the G-proteins? What does the "G" stand for?
    - guanine nucleotide-binding proteins
  - How do GPCRs transmit signals from outside to inside neurons?
    - Long story. See the GPCR activation part.
  - What is a second messenger?
    - Second messenger amplifies the signal inside the cell and can lead to a variety of cellular responses.
  - What are some advantages of GPCR signaling?
    - Diverse. Different time scales. Long lasting effects.

## The Serotonin System

- **Key words**: serotonin, dorsal praphe nucleus, tryptophan, antidepressant, monoamine monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).
- The neuromodulator serotonin is involved in a wide range of physiological processes such as hunger, sleep, and mood.
- The **dorsal praphe nucleus** releases serotonin in the brain.
- Serotonin receptors are found in many parts of the brain, including the hippocampus, neocortex, thalamus, amygdala as well as the spinal cord.
- **Tryptophan** -> Serotonin -> Calm, content, sleepy
- Little serotonin -> depression
- **Monoamine monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI)**
  - inhibits enzymes that break down serotonin, enhancing its effect by allowing it to stick around for longer.
  - is also used in other biochemical pathways to break down other substances, resulting in harmful accumulation of substances that the body can't break down.
- Tricyclic antidepressants -> reuptake of serotonin in synapses
  - This causes side effects. Not used.
- **Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)**
  - Examples: Fluoxetine, sertraline.
  - Blocking serotonin reuptake in the synaptic cleft in a relatively targeted way.
- Many different roles.
  - Common but easy to lead side effects.
- **Key questions**:
  - Where are the somas of all the serotonergic neurons located in the central nervous system? Where are the serotonergic receptors found in the brain?
    - Everywhere.
  - How does serotonin relate to depression?
    - It is not yet to be explained clearly but less serotonin causes depression.
  - MAOIs and tricyclic antidepressants are two families of molecules commonly used to treat depression. How do they act on serotonergic signalling?
    - The common goal of them is to increase serotonin.

## Neuropeptides

(For me this lecture is diffult to understand because of no visulization and unknown chemicals.)

- **Key words**: neuropeptide, opioid receptor
- Neuromodulators can act in large areas of the nervous system all at once.
- Neuropeptides are proteins.
- Neuropeptides are usually 5-20 amino acids long, which is small for a peptide, but very large for a neuromodulator.
- neuropeptides act exclusively through GPCRs.
- Neuropeptides form a large family of neuromodulators.
- Over 100 peptide varieties have been identified.
- Examples of neuropetides
  - **Hypocretin**: To regulate sleep.
  - **Leptin**: To be involved in appetite.
  - **Substance-P**: To modulate pain sensation.
- **Opioid** and its receptor
  - The activation of **opioid** receptors modulate **pain** perception.
  - Opium has an analgesic effect and reduces our perception of pain.
  - Opium consists of morphine and codeine.
  - The opioid receptors themselves turn out to be GPCRs.
- **Key questions**:
  - Neuropeptides interact with a very specific type of receptor. Which type is it?
  - What are some examples of neuropeptides?
  - Opioids are a large family of drugs, many of which are used for their therapeutic (and sometimes recreational) effects. Name a few examples of endogenous and exogenous opioids.
  - Through which receptors do endogenous and exogenous opioids act on the nervous system?

## The Dopamine System

- **Key words**: dopamine, dopamine pathway, substantia nigra, Parkison's disease, L-dopa, dopamine adaptation, down regulation.
- Dopamine is a neuromodulator.
- Dopamine is produced by a small number (100,000) of cells in the brain.
- Dopamine neurons and projections are very broad.
- **Dopamine pathways**
  - The mesocortical pathway, the mesolimbic pathway, the nigrostriatal pathway, and the tuberoinfundibular pathway.
- **Substantia nigra**: An orgin of dopamine. Related to movement.
- **Parkison's disease**
  - Patients lose the function of the substantia nigra.
  - Dopaminergic neurons die off in Parkinson's disease.
  - Symptoms: Stiffness, trembling limbs.
  - Treatment: **L-dopa**, a precursor of dopamine.
    - The effect is storng but short-lived.
- Dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area project to many areas of the brain.
- The nucleus accumbens form an important reward subsystem in the brain.
- Dopaminergic pathways from in the ventral tegmental area are involved in 
  - reward motivated behavior
  - reinforment learning
- Cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine in the synpatic cleft, which results in long-lasting dopamine.
- **Dopamine adaptation** is caused by down regulation.
- **Down regulation**: The process of reducing or suppressing a response to a stimulus
  - More drug is required to achieve the same effect.
  - A lower level of dopamine needs more drug.
- Functions of dopaminergic pathways
  - Endocrine or hormonal regulation and more.
- **Key questions**:

    - Reward motivated behavior and reinforcement learning
    - Dopamin adapation and down regulation.

## The Cholinergic System

- **Key words**: acetylcholine, diphenhydramine, scopolamine.
- **Acetylcholine** is the main excitatory **neurotransmitter** of the **peripheral** nervous system. It is also a crucial **neuromodulator** of the **central** nervous system. The neurotransmitter and neuromodulator have different concepts. 
- cholinergic outputs arise from a relatively small number of cells but act on a variety of brain areas in the neocortex, hippocampus, but also the brainstem and deeper nuclei.
- Acting mainly through the **M1 receptors**, the cholinergic system affects a variety of systems related to muscle and motor control, learning, short-term memory, and general arousal.
- The cholinergic system plays an important role in memory formation. Some anticholinergic drugs are applied for anterograde amnesia (a type of memory loss that occurs when you can't form new memories).
- **Diphenhydramine**
  - An allergy medication
  - An antihistamine that has potent anticholinergic effects
- **Scopolamine**
  - blocks some of the effects of acetylcholine.
  - causes anterograde amnesia.
  - causes an unfortunate victim to enter a dissociative state where they're unable to form plans and even unable to exercise free will. Because of scopolamine's amnesic effects, victims don't remember what happened to them while they were under the influence of the drug.
- **Types of neuromodulators**:
  1. **Agonist**: a drug that binds to its target receptor / and has the same effect as its normal ligand (generally activating the receptor): Excitation.
  1. **Antagonist**: a drug that binds to its target receptor / and prevents it from responding to the normal ligand (i.e., it prevents the receptor from being activated): Inhibition.
  1. **Competitive**: describes a drug that binds to the ligand binding site on a receptor, preventing the ligand from binding (unless there's a sufficient amount of ligand present so it can "out-compete" the drug): Competition.
  1. **Noncompetitive**: describes a drug that binds to a receptor at a location other than the ligand binding site, and modifies the receptor in a way that **prevents** it from binding to the ligand: Indirect inhibition.

## The Noradrenaline System

- **Key words**: noradrenaline (norepinephrine).
- **Noradrenaline**
  - Noradrenaline is released by cells in the **locus coeruleus** in the lateral segmental field or the pons of the brainstem involved with physiological responses to stress and panic.
  - The somas of the neurons releasing noradrenaline are all located in the brainstem.
  - Noradrenaline modulates general arousal: the **fight-or-flight response**, and the activation of the reward system.
- The noradrenaline system consists of just about 1,500 noradrenaline-secreting neurons in each brain hemisphere. Despite the small number of neurons involved, the noradrenaline system can exert a surprisingly strong impact on behavior, marshaling a readiness to act in nearly every corner of the body.
- **Key questions**:
  - Where are the somas of all the noradrenergic neurons located in the central nervous system?
    - locus coeruleus in the brain stem.
  - Which behaviors is noradrenaline associated with?
    - General arousal such as the fight-or-flight response, and the activation of the reward system.

## Deep Brain Stimulation

- Deep brain stimulation can help Parkison's disease.

## Susan's Brain - The Science of Addiction

- The opioid crisis: in the 1990's and early 2000's, doctors throughout North America overprescribed opioid-based painkillers, which has led to an epidemic of opioid addiction.
- As you watch the story of Susan, a patient who developed an addiction to opioids after a broken arm, you'll learn how opioid abuse can cause durable, harmful changes in the dopamine system.
