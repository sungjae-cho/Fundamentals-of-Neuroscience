## Fundamentals of the Action Potential

- Action potential = Spike
- Depolarization = Less polarized = Membrane potential (-) -> (+)
- Hyperpolarization = More polarized = Membrane potential (-) -> (-)
- Repolarization = Polarized again to the resting potential

## Voltage-Gated Channels

- Key questions:
  - Why can't passive leak channels allow for rapid changes in membrane potential?
  - What is the difference between leak channels and voltage-gated channels?
- Passive leak channel
- Voltage-gated channel
  - Voltage-gated channels open or close depending on the **local membrane potential**.
  - Voltage-gated channels can have different conductances depending on the membrane potential, which allows for neural signalling.
  - At a mechanistic level, these channels are complex molecular machines made from proteins.
  - As the voltage across the membrane changes, the push and pull of the charged parts of their structure shifts the conformation of the protein, either opening or closing the pore of the channel.

## The Phases of the Action Potential

- Key questions:
  - What is the threshold for an action potential, and what happens with voltage-gated Na+ channels at this voltage?
  - What are the phases of the action potential, and which channels are open/closed during each phase?
  - What is Na+ channel 'inactivation'? Why is this inactivation important for making the action potential?
- The action potential is caused by the action of two main voltage-gated ion channels: voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels.
- Non-voltage-gated vs. voltage-gated ion channels
- Positive feedback loop of Na+ influx.
  1. Membrane potential increases.
  1. More voltage-gated Na+ channels open.
  1. Na+ rushes in.
- This positive feedback loop enables rapid Na+ influx and positive membrane potential. 
- The positivity of membrane potential makes voltage-gated Na+ channels inactive by blocking their own channels. This inactive state is called **inactivation**.
- Speed (?) of voltage-gated channels: Na+ > K+
- Voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels open and close at particular times, creating ion flow that underlies the shape of the action potential.
- **Phases**: O: Open, X: Inactive (closed by the ball and chain), None: Closed (closed by the narrowed channel).
  1. Resting phase
  1. Stimulation
  1. Rising phase (Na+ O)
  1. Falling phase (Na+ X, K+ O)
  1. Undershoot (K+)
  1. Recovery = Resting phase
- Threshold for an action potential
- Inactivation of the voltage-gated Na+ channel

## Channels and Probability

- Key questions:
  - Is there a chance that a voltage-gated Na+ channel will be open when the membrane potential is -70mv?
  - What would the current trace look like if we examined just one channel? What would the current trace look like if we examined thousands of channels?
- How different voltage-gated channels can open and close in particular ways to give rise to the action potential?
- Opening and closing are stochastic process. In any period, open and closed voltage-gated channels are found. But the population ratio is clearly different in different periods.

## Channel Kinetics

- The Na+ channels have two gates: the activation and inactivation gates.
- Key questions:
  - What is meant by the term 'kinetics'?
  - What are the kinetics for the different channels and gates, and how does this lead to the shape of an action potential?
  - What is a 'refractory period'? What is the difference between the 'absolute' and the 'relative' refractory periods?
- The voltage gated Na+ and voltage gated K+ channels do not open at the same time.
  - This is caused by kinetics.
- **Kinetics**
 - Def: Probabilistic temporal dynamics of a reaction or movement from one state to another.
- **Refractory period**
  - Def: A period of time during which a neuron is unable to fire a second action potential.
- **Absolute refractory period**
  - During this phase, the neuron is completely incapable of triggering another action potential, no matter how strong the incoming signal might be.
  - It is primarily due to the inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, which are essential for the initiation of an action potential.
- **Relative refractory period**
  - Following the absolute refractory period, the neuron enters the relative refractory period. During this phase, it is possible for the neuron to fire another action potential, but this requires a much stronger stimulus than usual.
  - During this time, many of the voltage-gated sodium channels have returned to their resting state, but the membrane potential is more negative than usual due to ongoing potassium efflux.
- Kinetics (speed) of different channel processes during an action potential
  - Voltage-gated Na+ channel activation (and deactivation): Fast.
  - Voltage-gated Na+ channel inactivation: Slow. The process of blocking the channel with the ball and chain.
  - Voltage-gated K+ channel activation (and deactivation): Slow.
- If voltage-gated K+ channel activation were equally as fast as voltage-gated Na+ channel activation, the neuron cannot generate any action potential.
- In the relative refractory period, the open voltage-gated K+ channels make it more difficult to fire an action potential because the K+ current opposes any depolarization. If we try to nudge the membrane potential more positive, then the K+ current increases, since we increase the K+ driving force by moving the membrane potential farther from the Nernst potential of K+. This makes it harder, but not impossible, to trigger an action potential.

## The Currents Behind the Action Potential

- Key questions:
  - Why is it important that Na+ channels inactivate during an action potential?
  - Why is it necessary for an action potential that K+ channels are slower?
  -How are K+ and Na+ ions flowing (into the cell/out of the cell/no flow) during each phase of the action potential?
- A Na+ channel can be blocked by two ways.
  1. **Closing** by narrowing the voltage-gated Na+ channels activation gate. 
  1. **Inactivation** by blocking the voltage-gated Na+ channels inactivation gate.
- The closed and inactive states are exclusive to one another.
- **Neurotoxin**
  - A **neurotoxin** is a type of toxin that specifically targets the nervous system, affecting its structure or function. These toxins can disrupt the normal activity of nerve cells in various ways, leading to a range of neurological symptoms or disorders.
- **Tetrodotoxin (TTX)**
  - TTX blocks voltage-gated Na+ channels.
  - TTX is found in the pufferfish.
  - Application of TTX to a neuron will prevent an action potential from initiating.

## Lesson 3: Conclusion

- Action poential
- Passive property of the neuron: Non-voltage-gated channels.
- Active property of the neuron: Voltage-gated channels.
- The phases of action potential: O: Open, X: Inactive (closed by the ball and chain), None: Closed (closed by the narrowed channel). 
  1. Resting phase
  1. Stimulation
  1. Rising phase (Na+ O)
  1. Falling phase (Na+ X, K+ O)
  1. Undershoot (K+)
  1. Recovery = Resting phase
- The states of the Na+ voltage-gated channel: 
  - Open, closed (by the activation gate), inactive (by the inactivation gate)

In this lesson we've studied the main electrical signal used by neurons to convey information: the **action potential**. Action potentials are all-or-nothing signals characterized by large and rapid changes in membrane potential. However, the **passive** properties we have discussed previously were not enough to explain how an action potential occurs. We instead investigated the **active** properties of neurons, specifically the existence of **voltage-gated channels** that open and close with particular speeds in relation to each other.

The action potential itself has many phases, and we're able to characterize these phases by what happens during each. For example, the **rising phase** is defined as a time when the voltage-gated sodium channels have **opened**, while voltage-gated potassium channels remain **closed**, allowing the membrane to become **depolarized** (less negative) as sodium ions rush in. The **falling phase** is a time when the voltage-gated sodium channels have become **inactivated** while the voltage-gated potassium channels are opening, leading to an efflux of potassium ions and **repolarization**. The actions of thousands of these amazing molecular machines leads to particular ions flowing into or out of the neuron at certain times and thus gives us the characteristic action potential.

Now that we have an understanding of the action potential, a question remains: how is this electrical signal sent? This will be the next topic for discussion.
