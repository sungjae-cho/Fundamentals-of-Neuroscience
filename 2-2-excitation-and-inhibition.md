# 2-2 Excitation and Inhibition

## Excitation and Inhibition Overview

- Key words: excitatory synapse, inhibitory synapse, fast postsynaptic potential, slow postsynaptic potential.

## Life of a Neurotransmitter

- **Key words**: synaptic transmission speed, life cyle of a neurotransmitter.
- 1 us (micro-second) = $10^{-6}$ sec: Neurotransmitter's traverse duration
  - Once a neurotransmitter is released, it takes only about **one microsecond** (a millionth of a second) for it to traverse the synaptic cleft and contact the postsynaptic neuron.
- 0.05 miles per hour: Neurotransmitter's traverse speed = synaptic transmission speed
- 20-40 nm = $10^{-6}$ m
  - Synaptic cleft length
- Possbile phenomenon of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft
  - It could **bind** to its dedicated receptor.
  - It could **unbind** from its dedicated receptor.
  - It could potentially **activate** the postsynaptic cell **multiple times** before diffusing out of the synaptic cleft.
- **Life of a Neurotransmitter**
  1. Resorbing neurotransmitters: The entire neurotransmitter and postsynaptic receptor protein complex can be resorbed into the postsynaptic cell.
  1. Breaking down and recycling neurotransmitters:  Neurotransmitters can be broken down by specific enzymes that are present in the synaptic cleft.
  1. Taking up neurotransmitters: Neurotransmitters can be taken up by specific transporter proteins present on the surface of glial cells that surround and even sometimes invade the synaptic cleft.
- **Key questions**: 
  - What would happen if neurotransmitters stayed too long in the synaptic cleft?
  - What are the four mechanisms that keep neurotransmitters from diffusing away once they are released?


## EPSPs and IPSPs

- **Key words**: EPSP (excitatory postsynaptic potential), IPSP (inhibitory postsynaptic potential), fast EPSP
- 3 main differences of synapses
  - Fast vs. Slow synapses
  - Strong vs. Weak synapses
  - Excitatory vs. Inhibitory synapses
  - (Electrical vs. Chemical synapses)
- Effect from EPSPs at axon hilock influenced by:
  - Shape of dendritic arbor
  - Distance between the synapse and the cell body
  - Number of other inhibitory and excitatory neurons
  - Timing of the inputs
- The IPSP subtly changes the electrical properties of the membrane to work against EPSPs.
- Roles of inhbitory synapses
  - Open chloride channels. -> Lower membrane potential.
  - Open potassium channels. -> Lower membrane potential.
  - Block calcium channels.
- Locations of inhibitory synapses
  - Dendrite
  - Soma
- Depending on the location of inhibitory synapses, their function changes.
- The balance and interplay of excitation and inhibition of the nervous system is a complicated issue.
- A single action potential in a postsynaptic neuron usually produces an EPSP with an amplitude of at most a few millivolts, which is not large enough to reach threshold in the postsynaptic cell.
- **Fast EPSPs are usually mediated by sodium ionotropic channels.**
- **IPSPs are usually mediated by chloride-selective ionotropic channels.**
- **Key questions**:
  - What happens to the postsynaptic potential when you stimulate the excitatory (blue) neuron?
  - What happens to the postsynaptic potential when you stimulate the inhibitory (red) neuron?
  - Are the signals recorded at the synapses versus the hillock of the postsynaptic neuron (yellow) identical? Why or why not?
    - Not identical. The signal attenuates.

## EPSPs in Depth

- **Key words**: motor end plate, end plate potential (EPP)
- **Motor end plate**: The postsynaptic compartment on muscles.
- **End plate potential (EPP)**: Muscular EPSP.
- Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) = **Ionotropic** acetylcholine receptors
  - It allows Na+, K+ and Ca2+ to permeate.
  - is a ligand-gated ion channel.
  - consists of 2 alpha, 1 beta 1 gamma and 1 delta subunits.
  - Size: External part > Internal part
  - Binding sites of Ach: 2 alpha subunits.
- Exogenous vs Endogenous
  - Exogenous: Originated from the body.
  - Endogenous: originated from the outside of the body.
- EPSP spiking process
  1. Ligand-gated AchRs open.
  1. EPSP reaches the spiking threshold.
  1. Voltage-gated Na+ channels open.
- **Key questions**:
  - How did "nicotinic receptors" get their name?
  - The nicotinic receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel. What does this mean?
  - What is the structure of the nicotinic receptor?
  - How do acetylcholine molecules interact with nicotinic receptors?
  - How does the opening of nicotinic receptors lead to muscle contraction?

## Acetylcholine Receptors In Depth

- **Key words**: acetylcholine receptor (AchR)
- AchR can allow Na+ and K+ to pass the memebrane. While Na+ goes inward, K+ go outward. This makes the net charge zero.
  - Inward current = Outward current
- ReversalPotential(nAchR) = -10mV = averaged Nernst potentials of Na+ and K+ = (60mV + -80mV)/2
  - Opening nArhR allows EPSP to increase to -10mV from the resting potnetial -70mV.
- **Desnsitization** of nAchR
  - In the case of the acetylcholine receptor and for other ligand gated ion channels, there's a built-in safety mechanism to avoid unwanted excitation or inhibition.
  - If channels are open for a long time due to the repeated action of neurotransmitters binding and unbinding from the channel, individual channels will close.
  - **Succinylcholine** is commonly used in surgical practice as a muscle relaxant because it causes desensitization of the acetylcholine receptor. This chemical remains in the synaptic cleft without being broken down as AchR. This leads to repetive binding to nAchR.
  - Curare, hexamethonium and alpha bungarotoxin are disable AchRs and weaken the skeletal muscles.
- Equilibrium vs. Reversal Potentials
  - The **equilibrium (or Nernst) potential of an ion** is the membrane potential at which there is no net flow of said ion through the membrane. You can calculate an equilibrium potential of an ion with the Nernst equation.
  - The **reversal potential of an ionic channel** is the membrane potential at which the net current through said channel is zero. You can calculate the reversal potential of an ion channel with the GHK equation.
  - If a channel is permeable to a single type of ions, then the equilibrium and reversal potentials are the same.
- **Key questions**:
  - Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are referred to as "promiscuous cation channels." What does this mean?
    - The receptors can allow multiple types of cations - Na+, K+ and Ca2+ - to pass the membrane.
  - What gives the central pore of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor its cation specificity?
    - The pore is negatively charged; thus, the receptor has cation specificity.
  - How do sodium and potassium flow through the channel once it is open?
    - The middle of the pore becomes negatively charged and attract the cations.
  - What does "reversal potential" mean, in terms of ion flow?
    - For the ionotropic receptor, the reversal potential is the average of the Nernest potentials of Na+ and K+, increase EPSP, and cause depolarization.
  - What does it mean for a receptor to be "desensitized"?
    - After frequent binding on nAchRs, they stop allowing for permeability.
  - How can drugs affect the function of nicotinic receptors?
    - They bind to the receptors and stop allowing for their permeability.

## Excitation Disease States

- **Key words**: myasthenia gravis, autoimmune disease, congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS), genetic mutation, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, immunosuppressant. 
- Myasthenia gravis or congenital myasthenic syndrome can also influence the delicate excitation/inhibition balance that is necessary to ensure proper function of our nervous system.
- **Myasthenia gravis** is an autoimmune disorder that leads to serious muscle weakness and fatigue.
  - **Autoimmune disease** happens when the body's natural defense system can't tell the difference between your own cells and foreign cells, causing the body to mistakenly attack normal cells.
  - The weak muscles are caused by circulating antibodies in the blood that block or even lead to the destruction of acetylcholine receptors of the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction. As a result, acetylcholine can't excite the postsynaptic cell, and it can't stimulate muscle contraction.
  - Treatment: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and **immunosuppressants**
- **Congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS)**  is an inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by defects of the proteins that make up the neuromuscular junction.
  - Not an autoimmune disorder.
  - Postsynaptic defects are the most frequent cause of CMS.
  - More than half of the currently known **genetic mutations** associated with CMS are found in one of the four genes encoding the **acetylcholine receptor subunits**.
  - Immunosuppressive treatments used in myasthenia gravis are generally not useful for CMS patients.
  - Treatment: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as quinidine or fluoxetine.
    - Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase from breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetate, thereby increasing both the level and duration of action of acetylcholine.
- **Key questions**:
  - Myasthenia gravis is an "autoimmune channelopathy." What does this mean?
    - Autoimmune systems disable AchRs.
  - How does myasthenia gravis impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction?
    - Antibodies block or even lead to the destruction of AchRs.
  - What are the similarities / differences between myasthenia gravis and congenital myasthenic syndrome?
    - Similarity: Malfunction on AchRs.
    - Difference: Causes from either autoimmune diseases or genetic mutations.
  - How are these syndromes treated?
    - See the treatments above.
    
## Glutamate and Glutamate Receptors

  - Central nervous system: Glutamate
- Acetylcholine is the most prevalent excitatory neurotransmitter outside of the peripheral nervous system.
- **Glutamate**
  - In the central nervous system, however, the vast majority of fast excitatory synapses release **glutamate**.
  - Glutamate is an amino acid, a building block of proteins.
  - Glutamate also acts as a neurotransmitter when released by **glutamatergic neurons**.
  - Receptors: AMPA and NMDA **ionotropic receptors**
- **G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)**
  - is not an ion channel.
  - is a **metabotropic receptor**, which is fast.
  - senses molecules outside of the cell and activates ultimately cellular responses inside the cell.
  - is involved in many diseases and are the target of approximately 40% of all modern medicinal drugs.
- **Key questions**:
  - In the brain, how can a single neurotransmitter, such as glutamate, show a diversity of postsynaptic effects?
  - What is the difference between ionotropic and metabotropic receptors?
  - What does "GPCR" stand for? What is the general mechanism of action of GPCRs?

## AMPA and NMDA Receptors

- **Ligand-gated ion channel** = ionotropic receptor
- **AMPA receptor**
  - glutaminergic ionotropic/ligand-gated channel
  - promiscuous: permeable to all cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, ...)
- **NMPA receptor**
  - glutaminergic ionotropic/ligand-gated channel
  - promiscuous: permeable to all cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, ...)
  - equilibrium potential: 0mV
  - is related to long-term synaptic plasticity and learning and memory function.
  - can be activated both by ligand binding and by changes in membrane potential.
  - has a magnesium ion blocking its central pore.
  - Voltage-dependency: When the membrane gets depolarized, magnesium exits the NMDA receptor. It needs an initial depolarization to have a chance to open.
  - **Condincidence detector**: NMDA receptors get activated not only when there is glutamate released into the cleft (a presynaptic event), but also when AMPA receptors start getting activated (a postsynaptic event).
    - AMPA activation -> depolarization + NMDA binding -> NMDA activation
- **Key questions**:
  - What types of postsynaptic potentials (excitatory or inhibitory etc.) do AMPA and NMDA receptors generate?
    - Excitatory postsynaptic potential.
  - How are AMPA and NMDA receptors similar to nicotinic receptors?
    - ionotropic
  - What type(s) of signals (mechanical, chemical, electrical etc.) can open the central pore of AMPA and NMDA receptors?
    - AMPA: chemical
    - NMDA: chemical + electrical

    - Benzodiazepine -> enhancing the effect of GABA at the central GABA receptor
    - Achohol -> modulating GABA receptors -> calm
- **Shunting**
  - Shunting occurs when a charged **chloride** influx **counterbalances** the positively charged sodium influx of excitatory synapses.
  - By opening the inhibitory channels, the membrane resistance decreases, which inhbits action potential.
  - V/R = I: Divisive inhibition
  - [Video: Shunting inhibition](https://youtu.be/dmrrGkfcfNw?si=UJAOIxfu7osi_Z4m&t=546)

## Lesson 2 Conclusion

Excitation and inhibition play a crucial role in the proper function of the central and peripheral nervous system. Like so many things in biology, proper synaptic function is a delicate and orchestrated balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs, mediated by specific neurotransmitters and their postsynaptic receptors.

It is important to remind ourselves that fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials are mediated primarily by cation-selective ion channels, while fast inhibitory postsynaptic potentials are mediated primarily by anion-selective ion channels.

In the **peripheral nervous system**, the primary excitatory receptors are **nicotinic acetylcholine receptors**, which conduct both sodium and potassium, while the primary inhibitory receptors are **chloride-conducting glycine receptors**.

In the **central nervous system**, the primary excitatory receptors are the **NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptors**, which both are promiscuous to calcium, sodium and potassium. The main inhibitory receptors in the brain are the **chloride-conducting GABA receptors**.

Overall, the remarkable thing about the nervous system is the fact that this delicate **excitation-inhibition balance** can be achieved with a small number of neurotransmitters and ions but a vast diversity of postsynaptic receptors and specific synaptic connections. Next, we'll take a look at how neurons integrate signals from multiple inputs in small circuits.

## Tye Lab: Optogenetics

(I have not fully watched the video.)

Kay Tye is professor of neuroscience at MIT, where she studies the neural basis of emotional and motivational states. One simple question that drives her research is "how do we know if something is good or bad?" Despite its apparent simplicity, this question remains largely unsolved. What is better understood, however, is the neuronal circuit involved in emotion and motivation: the limbic system. Follow Kay and her team, as they explain how they took advantage of a groundbreaking technique, optogenetics*, to unravel how the limbic system works.

**Optogenetics** is a technique that was invented in the early 2000's. It relies on a light-activated cation channel found in algae, channelrhodopsin. Specific populations of neurons can be genetically modified to synthesize channelrhodopsin. **Researchers can then stimulate these neurons by shining light on them, allowing precise control over their behavior**.
