# 1-2 Introduction: Passive Membrane Properties

- Key words: Action potential, resistance, capacitance, passive membrane
  - Passive membrance >< Active membrane
  - Active membrane: Membrane with operating ion pumps, which consume ATP.

## Changing the Membrane Potential

- The Nernst potential of an ion is an example of equilibrium.
- The resting potential of a neuron is an example of the steady state.

## Introduction to Resistance

- Key questions:
  - What is resistance?
  - What is conductance?
  - What is the difference between membrane and axial resistance?
  - How do changes to the properties of a neuron affect the membrane and axial resistance?
- Resistance: The property of a material or an electronic component that opposes the flow of electric current.
  - Resistor
  - Membrane resistance: The resistance to the flow of ions across the membrane (ohms/square mm).
  - Cytoplasm resistance = Axial resistance: The resistance to the flow of ions down the axon (ohms/square mm).
- Current
- Conductance: The measure of how easily electricity flows through a component or a circuit.
- If we make the axon larger in diameter,
  - Membrane resistance decreases.
    - Conductance per area is the same.
    - The whole area increases.
  - Axial (internal) resistance decreases.
    - The axial area increases.

## Introduction to Capacitance

- Key questions:
  - What is capacitance?
  - What does it means to 'buffer' voltage changes?
  - How will changes to the properties of a neuron affect the membrane capacitance?
- The capacitor stores electrical charge.
  - The capcitor has an insulating region called a dialectric.
- If a membrane has a higher capacitance, it has a greater ability to build up charges on its two sides and so it will take longer for the membrane voltage to change.
- If the capacitance is lower, the membrane voltage will change more quickly. We will return to this point with the idea of a 'time constant' later in this lesson.

## Current and Ohm's Law

- Key questions:
  - What is meant by 'current' as it relates to a neuron?
  - What is Ohm's Law?
  - How can we use Ohm's Law to predict how changes in one variable can lead to changes in other variables?
- Ohm's Law: `(voltage) = (current) * (resistance)`

## Resistance in the Neuron

- Key questions:
  - What is the length constant? If an electrical signal travels 1 length constant, by what percent has it decreased?
  - How are membrane resistance and axial resistance related to the length constant?
  - How do membrane and axial resistance affect the distance current travels down an axon?
- Two types of resistance
  - Membrane resistance
  - Axial resistance
- Length constant $`\lambda=\sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{mem}}}{R_{\text{axial}}}}`$: 
  - Meaning: How far a voltage change will travel until it reaches approximately 37% of its initial value. Voltage decay/attenuation. 
  - This is originated from the cable equation.
  - High membrane resistance -> More current leakage -> More attenuation -> Weaker current
  - High axial resistance -> Weaker current: Straightforward.
- How to apply the length constant:
  - $`0.37^{d/\lambda} = V_{\text{end}}/V_{\text{start}}`$ ($d$ is the distance between the start and end points.)

## Membrane Capacitance

- Key topic: Membrane capacitance and its contribution to responsiveness.
- Key questions:
  - What is the time constant? If a voltage step of 100 mV is applied to a neuron, approximately how much has the voltage changed after 1 time constant?
  - How are membrane resistance and membrane capacitance related to the time constant?
  - What are some differences between the time constant and the length constant?
- Myelination
  - increases membrane resistance. -> Long-distance propagation.
  - decreases capatitance. -> Faster responsiveness.
- Time constant
  - $`\tau = R_{\text{mem}} C_{\text{mem}}`$
  - Meaning: How long it takes a piece of membrane to charge up to 63% of its final value in response to a step change in its input voltage.
  - Low time constant: Slow.
  - High time constant: Fast.
  - $R_{\text{mem}}$ $\downarrow$, ion channels $\downarrow$.
  - $C_{\text{mem}}$ $\downarrow$, membrane thickness $\uparrow$.
- It is likely that the membrane length constant and time constant change together. However, their increament and decrement do not alway happen together.

## Lesson 2: Conclusion

In Lesson 1, we investigated the **resting potential**, and we’ve now begun to think about what may occur when we change the membrane potential of a neuron. A change in voltage can be used as an electrical signal. Before we delving into these electrical signals, we’ve first discussed the **passive properties** of a neuron. These passive properties are important to understand because they will greatly affect how a neuron is able to send and to receive electrical signals, as discussed in the next lessons.

Two main concepts that we’ve addressed in this lesson are resistance and capacitance. **Resistance** is opposition to the flow of current, and, for a neuron, we consider both the membrane and the axial resistance and how they can affect electrical signals. The **membrane resistance** describes how well current passes through the membrane while the **axial resistance** describes how well current passes through the cytoplasm. **Capacitance** is the ability to store charge, and, in the neuron, the membrane acts as a capacitor and stores charge through a buildup of ions on either side of the membrane. All of these concepts are related to each other in a famous equation: **Ohm’s Law**.

A consideration of both **passive** and, as we'll see next, **active** properties, is vital for understanding how neurons are able to send electrical signals.
