# 2-3 Small Circuits

## Introduction to Lesson 3

- Key words: synaptic integration, synaptic efficacy

## Small Circuits Overview

- Activity propagation: dendrite -> soma -> axon -> synapse 

## Information Processing

- Key words: synaptic integration.
- Synaptic integration: Neurons combine information from many synapses at once. The integration happens in a neuron.
- Group of neurons: circuit
- Distinct regions in a neuron
- Excitatory input occurs on dendritic spines.
- Inhibitory input occurs on dendritic shafts.
- 5 critical factors to regulate synaptic integration:
  1. Distance
  1. Non-linear summation
  1. Inhibitory input blocking excitatory input
  1. Temporal summation
  1. Inhibitory input blocking temporal summation
- **Key questions**:
  - How are inhibitory and excitatory synapses distributed?
    - Excitatory synapses are at dendritic spines.
    - Inhibitory synapses are at dendritic shafts.
  - Do neurons usually receive only excitatory (or inhibitory) inputs?
    - No, they receive both types of inputs.
  - What are the critical factors that regulate synaptic integration?
    - See above.

## Synaptic Efficacy and Distance

- **Key words**: 
- **Distance** between the synapse and the cell body
  - Cause: Total axial resistance. Imagine the length constant.
- **The propagation of action potentials down the axons is a regenerative process**.
- **Dendrites have no voltage-gated channels**. 
- As a consequence, the **propagation of EPSPs along the dendritic tree is NOT a regenerative process**, and EPSPs lose amplitude as they get closer to the cell body.
- In a thinner neuron the internal axial resistance is higher and thus the conduction velocity is lower.
- **Key questions**:
  - Complete this sentence: "As an EPSP travels down the dendrite, its amplitude gets [blank]".
    - Attenuated.
  - Identify the physiological parameters that influence this change in amplitude and explain how they relate to the length constant.
    - Length constant associated with the axial resistance.
  - Describe the other parameter(s) that influence EPSP attenuation.
    - The radius of a dendrite, which decreases the axial resistance.

## Synaptic Summation

- **Key words**: synaptic summation, nonlinearity of synaptic summation.
- **Dynaptic summation is nonlinear** because
  1. Driving force: The closer the membrane potential gets to the reversal potential, the lower the net driving force and the LOWER (not higher) the net depolarization added.
  1. Dendritic action potentials: Complex to describe.
  1. Action potential backpropagtion: Complex to describe.
- **Key questions**:
  - Complete this sentence: "All other things being equal, when you simultaneously stimulate two excitatory synapses equally far away from the soma, the resulting EPSP recorded at the soma is [blank] than the EPSP of each synapse separately".
    - greater
  - Explain what is meant by the statement: Synaptic summation is a nonlinear process.
    - The arithmetic summed potential of the increments from different synapses is not eqaul to the real summed potential from those synapses.  
  - Explain the main causes of this nonlinearity.
    - Driving force, dendritic action potentials, action potential backpropagation.

## Synaptic Inhibition

"How EPSPs and IPSPs are integrated"

- **Key words**: synaptic inhibition
- Inhibition is equally important in maintaining the excitation / inhibition balance required for normal brain function
- Postsynaptic inhibitory receptors open chloride channels.
- Where
  - Inhibition: soma, axon initial segment
  - Excitation: dendritic arbor
- **Key questions**:
  - Explain how excitatory and inhibitory synapses are distributed.
    - See above.
  - Explain why IPSPs are not "visible" in the soma.
    - NernstV(Cl-) = RestingV
  - Explain what happens when you stimulate the excitatory and inhibitory neurons at the same time, and why this occurs.

## Synaptic Temporal Summation

- **Key words**: synaptic temoporal summation.
- **Key questions**:
  - What happens when an excitatory neuron is stimulated multiple times (as opposed to once)?
    - The postsynaptic potentials are summed up and form a larger potential than that caused by a single spike.
  - How does the shape recorded from a single EPSP relate to the recording that follows repeated stimulation of an excitatory neuron?
    - EPSP gradually increases and surges at a certain moment.

## Synaptic Temporal Inhibition

- **Key words**: synaptic temporal inhibition
- **Key questions**:
  - What happens when you stimulate the green (E), then purple (I), then green (E) neurons in rapid succession?
    - The only one EPSP from the last stimulation on the green neurons is observed.
  - What is the cause of synaptic temporal inhibition?
    - Synaptic inhibition can inhibit excitatory potential in a close time range.
- The shape caused by synaptic temporal inhibition is like shirk's fin.


## Convergence and Divergence

- **Key words**: convergence, divergence, stretching reflex
- **Key questions**:
  - What are the three major motifs that shape neuronal circuits?
    1. Convergence
      - Multiple potentially disparate inputs come together to synapse on a single downstream neuron.
      - Our brains are constantly bringing together scraps of ambiguous sensory information from different senses and synthesizing them together into a coherent whole.
    1. Divergence
      - One neuron sends a signal to many.
    1. Recurrence
  - What is the stretch reflex? How does it work? What network motif(s) does it illustrate?
- 3 motifs
  1. Convergence
    - Multiple potentially disparate inputs come together to synapse on a single downstream neuron.
    - Our brains are constantly bringing together scraps of ambiguous sensory information from different senses and synthesizing them together into a coherent whole.
  1. Divergence
    - One neuron sends a signal to many.
  1. Recurrence
    - Next lecture.
- **Stretching reflex** = myotatic reflex: An example of pure convergence and divergence in the nervous system.
  - When a muscle is stretched, the stretch reflex regulates the length of the muscle automatically by increasing its contractility as long as the stretch is within the physiological limits.
  - Alpha motor neuron activity causes the muscle fibers to contract and resist stretching.
  - Muscle spindle: A stretch receptor that signals the length and changes in length of muscles.

## Central Pattern Generators

- **Key words**:
- **Key questions**:
  - What is recurrence?
  - Central pattern generators are an example of recurring circuits. Where are they found in the body? What kinds of actions do they control? How do they work?
  - Do central pattern generators work in isolation?
- Recurrence (motif)
  - Some chain of connected neurons eventually loops back onto itself (feedback).
  - An example: Central Pattern Generator
- **Central Pattern Generator (CPG)**
  - Self-organizing biological neural circuits that produce rhythmic outputs in the absence of rhythmic input.
  - Two or more processes interact such that each process sequentially increases and decreases. As a result of this interaction, the system repeatedly returns to its starting condition.
  - Almost any temporal pattern of activity could be created.
  - External modulators make CPGs slower or faster, or start or stop.
  - CPGs have been found in invertebrates and practically all vertebrate species investigated, including humans.
  - Example activities: 
    - Rhythmic muscle activity that governs swimming in molluscs.
    - Rhythmic contractions of our own digestive tract.
  - My thought: This may why it is easy to keep rhythmical action than irregular one.

## Lesson 3 Conclusion

Hopefully by now you've gotten a flavor of how simple network features like **convergence, divergence and recurrence** can produce an array of complex behaviors, even in circuits containing just a handful of neurons. Understanding how these principles work together to give rise to even more complex behaviors is an area of open debate, but it's clear that **the connectivity of brain circuits plays a huge role in determining what a circuit does**. In the next lesson, we'll add an additional layer of complexity - neuromodulation.

Understanding neuronal connectivity is so important, that large-scale international efforts are currently underway to densely map out the connections in the brains of model organisms, such as the laboratory mouse.

In a bonus video for this lesson, we'll visit some of the scientists doing this work, and explore **how understanding the structure of brain connectivity can give us important clues about how the brain works**.
