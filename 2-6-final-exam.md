# 2-6 Final Exam

This note just contains what I have learned while answering questions in the exam.

- The brain, reflex circuites and heart have electrical synapses.
  - "Electrical synapses are often found in neural systems that require the fastest possible response, such as defensive reflexes. An important characteristic of electrical synapses is that they are mostly bidirectional, allowing impulse transmission in either direction."
- In vertebrates, acetylcholine is the primary neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction, whereas glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.
- How vesicles fuse in the presynaptic terminal
  1. The axon at the presynaptic terminal depolarizes.
  1. Voltage-dependent calcium channels open.
  1. Calcium concentration inside the presynaptic terminal increases.
  1. v-SNAREs and t-SNAREs coil tightly together.
  1. The vesicular and synaptic membranes fuse together.
- False: The neurotransmitter remains in the synaptic cleft and activates the postsynaptic terminal multiple times.
- How do we classify whether a synapse is excitatory or inhibitory?
  - Determining whether a synapse is excitatory or inhibitory is based on its contributing to changing firing behavior of the postsynaptic neuron.
  - When ligand gated chloride channels are opened, the Nernst Potential of chloride is typically less negative than the resting potential. Thus, the neuron actually depolarizes. However, chloride synapses are classified as inhibitory because the shunting mechanism of chloride actually makes the postsynaptic neuron less likely to fire.
- The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor consists of 2 alpha, 1 beta 1 gamma and 1 delta subunits.
  - Its binding site of Ach is 2 alpha subunits.
- Glutamate does not affect the peripheral nervous system.
- AMPA receptors are the most commonly found receptor in the brain. (AMPA > NMDA)
- Neurotransmitters
  - Excitatory: achetylcholine, glutamate.
  - Inhibitory: GABA, glycine.
- The potential summation is not linear because the more depolarized the membrane potential is, the higher potential needed.
- The duration of action potential
  - In a typical nerve, the action potential duration is about 1 ms.
  - In skeletal muscle cells, the action potential duration is approximately 2-5 ms.
  - In contrast, the duration of cardiac action potentials ranges from 200 to 400 ms.
- **Glycine synapses**
  - Ionotropic receptors: Cl-.
  - Location: spinal cord, brainstem.
  - Functional role: 
    - In spinal cord: modulation of motor and reflex activities.
    - In brainstem: modulation of sensory and autonomic functions.
- **GABA synapses**
  - Location: brain, spinal cord.
  - Functinal role:
    - Regulation of neuronal excitability
    - Modulation of synaptic plasticity
    - Shaping of neural network activities
  - Two types: GABA-A, GABA-B
    - GABA-A
      - Ionotropic receptor: Cl-.
    - GABA-B
      - metabotropic receptor -> G-protein -> changing K+ or Ca2+ channels
- EPSP or IPSP at dendrites and somas.
- Spikes at axons.
- The **knee-jerk reflex**, or **patellar reflex**, is **monosynaptic**: there is only one synapse between the stimulus and the muscular response. It is a **stretch reflex**: the reflex is initiated as a response to the stretching of the patellar tendon. It is **invontutary**, as the reflex happens without you being conscious of it. Finally, it is an example of both **convergence**, as the signals from many stretch receptors are combined at the motor neuron in the spinal cord, and **divergence**, as the mechanosensory neurons will send signals to the motor neurons of the muscles on both sides of the thigh.
- The process of releasing neurotransmitters: **Ca2++ outside -> Postsynaptic depolarization -> Ca2++ inside -> neurotransmitters are released**
- miniature EPPs occurs randomly fused acetylcholines from vesicles.
- Metabotropic receptors amplify signals through a signaling cascade. Furthermore, they can durably act on multiple targets at once. Therefore, metabotropic signals bridge between neurotransmission and the intracellular molecular life of the cell.
- Which of the following features support(s) the use of neuromodulators as therapeutic targets? (choose all that apply)
  - They affect a few cells surrounding a modulatory synapse.
  - They often act system-wide with long-range behavioral manifestations.
  - They can modulate a target cell's molecular composition and its functional behavior.
- Neuropeptides are larger than serotonin: as a consequence, they diffuse more slowly.
  - Neuropeptides are usually larger than neurotransmitters.
- Cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine, leaving these neurotransmitters in the synaptic gap for longer.
- The noradrenaline and serotonergic pathways are examples of divergence because their axons branch to numerous areas.
