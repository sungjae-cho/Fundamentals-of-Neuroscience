## Signals in the Nervous System

- Key question:
  - How do these electrical signals travel within and between neurons?
- The diffusion of signaling molecules is too slow to control the body quickly.

## Electrical Signaling

- Key questions:
  - What challenges does a neuron need to overcome in order to send an electrical signal?
  - How do neurons propagate signals?
- For faster communication: Molecule signal < Electrical singal
- The nervous system must be able to send signals over fairly large distances, and nature doesn't have the luxury of using a material as conductive as copper.
- Problem: Current leakage/attenuation
  - Solution 1: Increase action potential amplitude.
  - Solution 2: Move the state of depolarization down the axon.

## Signals as State

- Propagation of a state of depolarization
- Key questions:
  - What does it mean to propagate a 'state of depolarization'?
  - How does an action potential in one region of an axon affect other nearby patches of membrane?
- Chain reaction
  - Domino
  - Water wave

## Getting from Point A to Point B

- Key questions:
  - What is the shape of **voltage versus distance plot** as an action potential passes by a point?
  - Why can action potentials propagate bidirectionally?
  - How do the absolute and relative refractory periods affect how propagating axons interact with each other?
- What will a plot of action potential voltage versus distance look like?
  - It would look like an action potential that had been flipped left-to-right.
    - Closest distance: Refractory phase
    - Secondly closest distance: Depolarization phase
    - Farthest distance: Potential between the resting and threshold potential.
- It is hard to distort an action potential during the absolute and relative refractory periods.
  - ARP: Because the voltage-gated Na+ channels are closed.
  - RRP: Because the voltage-gated K+ channels are open.
- Colliding action potentials
  - Colliding action potentials are canceled out because of the refractory period at the collision location.
- Question 7 is written in a confusing way. The 'little change' in the middle can be both absolute and relative refractory periods.

## Speeding Up the Action Potential

- Capacitance depends on the membrane thickness.
- Variables affecting the propagation speed (+ and -: increasing and decreasing relationships)
  1. (-) $R_{\text{mem}}$
  1. (-) $C_{\text{mem}}$
  1. (+) Density of voltage-gated ion channels
  1. (-) $R_{\text{axial}}$, membrane length constant $\lambda_{\text{mem}}$

## Giant Axons

- One common observation in nature is that some animals use a ‘giant’ axon that allows for very fast conduction of action potentials.
- Key questions:
  - Why does the giant axon allow for fast conduction of an action potential?
  - What disadvantages are there for using a giant axon?
- Detriments to having a large axon
  - The axon takes up a lot of space.
  - Larger axons require more energy to maintain a resting potential.
  - Larger axons require more voltage-gated Na+ channels.
  - More mitochondria are needed to allow cellular processes to occur.

## Myelinated Axons

- Myelin forms a fatty insulating sheath around neuronal fibers.
- Myelin is produced by cells called glia.
- Key questions:
  - What is the difference between a myelin sheath and a 'node of Ranvier'?
  - How does myelin affect membrane resistance and capacitance?
- Myelin is primarily made up of lipids, which gives its characteristic white appearance.
- Myelin sheath
  - Insulator.
- Node of Ranvier
  - The spacing between the myelin sections.
  - It contains a high density of voltage gated sodium and potassium channels.
- How does myelin affect membrane resistance and capacitance?
  - Myelination -> Fewer ion channels -> Higher resistance 
  - Myelination -> Thicker membrane -> Lower capacitance

## Myelination I

- How to speed up action potentials
  1. Thicker axon
  1. Myelination
- Key questions:
  - What is myelin and what kind of cells produce it?
    - Glia supporting cells prodduce myelin.
  - How does myelin change the passive properties of an axon?
  - What is the importance of the Nodes of Ranvier?
  - How do electrical signals travel differently in a myelinated versus an unmyelinated axon, and what is the phenomenon called "saltatory conduction"?
- Myelin makes the membrane resistance increase because any leakage channels that would have previously allowed the flow of ions through the membrane are now blocked by the myelin.
- At the same time, decreasing the capacitance reduces the time constant of the membrane, speeding up changes in membrane potential.
- **Saltatory conduction**: This jumping of the action potential from one node to another down a myelinated axon.
- The **dielectric constant** represents the resistance between a capacitor's plates. Myelin increases the dielectric constant.
- Along an axon,
  - Passively spread ionic current.
  - Re-initiate the action potential.

## Myelination II

- Removing the myelin stops the action potential dead in its tracks.
- Without any Nodes of Ranvier, the passive spread of charge along the completely myelinated axon will dissipate.
- Patients with Demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis lose the ability to transmit signals down their axons. The result is gradual, debilitating paralysis.

## Lesson 4: Conclusion

At the beginning of this course, we established that neurons can have an electrical potential across their membrane and are able to use electrical signaling. The overall goal we've had is to understand the electrical properties of the neuron and how an electrical signal is sent. This led us to investigate both the passive and the active properties of the membrane.

We've now reached the end of Lesson 4, and we've brought all of this knowledge about active and passive properties together. We've seen that action potentials can propagate down an axon as a state of depolarization. In other words, depolarization of one section of the membrane can cause depolarization in adjacent segments of the membrane. The passive properties of the membrane, the resistive and capacitive properties, greatly affect the speed at which an action potential travels.

Of course, in the nervous system, we want signals to be sent fast. One solution observed in nature is the use of a giant axon. Another solution, which is found in humans, is the use of a myelin sheath. Myelin serves as insulation for the neuron and allows charge to travel faster and farther. The movement of an action potential down a myelinated axon occurs by '**saltatory conduction**.' This name is given because the action potential is regenerated at **Nodes of Ranvier** where there are many ion channels, while charge passively spreads along the myelinated segments.
