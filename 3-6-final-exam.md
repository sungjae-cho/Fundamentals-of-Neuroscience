# 3-6 Final Exam

## Part 1: Vision

- Rhodopsin is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) in the membrane of photoreceptor cells. It contains a photosensitive pigment called retinal which changes conformation when it absorbs photons, causing a corresponding change in the rhodopsin protein and activating the intracellular G-protein.
- Photoreceptors release glutamate in the dark. ON-center bipolar cells are inhibited by dark stimuli in the center of their receptive field. This means that glutamate must be inhibiting the ON-center bipolar cells.
- Receptive fields have been identified for sensory neurons in the visual, somaotosensory and auditory systems.
- **Retinotopy**: Spatial organization from the retina is preserved in V1.
- (I am not sure of the process in the retinal circuits, especially the process of rhodopsins.)

## Part 3: Touch, Taste, Smell, and the Remaining Senses

- A single olfactory receptor can be activated by many different odorants.
- Capsaicin creams do not cause any permanent damage to pain sensors, nor do they directly rewire the brain. They do, however, desensitize the pain cells - the concentration of capsaicin is sufficiently high to deplete the cells of the signaling molecules they need to send pain signals.

## Part 4: Movement and Action

- What is an easy way to discern control from the primary motory and premotor cortice.
  - Primary: controlling single muscles
  - Premotor: controlling multiple muscles
- In a fully developed healthy nervous system, lower motor neurons receive modulatory input from upper motor neurons and the motor cortex. This input can suppress primitive reflexes such as extension of the toes after plantar stimulation.

## Part 5: Subcortical Brain Areas

- The **hypothalamus** is responsible for maintaining homeostasis - this includes directing us to eat when we are hungry and stop eating when we are full.
- The **cingulate cortex** is part of the limbic system, which is involved in creating emotional and motivational context for our experience of the world.
- The **medulla** connects higher levels of the brain to the spinal cord.
