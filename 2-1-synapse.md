## Synapses: Overview

- Key words: synapse, electrical synapse, chemical synapse, synaptic cleft
- Key questions:
  - What do we mean when we say neurons are “polarized”?
  - How does this polarization constrain the way information travels within a neuron? Across neurons?
  - What is a synapse?
  - Synapses come in two flavors: electrical and chemical. What are the main structural and functional similarities and differences between the two?
- In neuroscience, the word "**polarization**" has two meanings:
  1. Neurons have a "**polarized" (or charged) membrane**: the electrical potentials inside and outside a neuron are different. More precisely, at rest neurons are usually negatively charged (around -65mV). Note that neurons are not the only polarized cells in your body; most cells have different electrical potentials that are different inside the cell relative to outside.
  1. "Polarization" also refers to the idea that the **two "ends" of a neuron have different characteristics**: one is specialized for receiving signals, the other for sending them. In a similar way, the cells that line your small intestine are polarized, too - the ends of the cells that are in contact with your food are specialized for absorbing nutrients, while the ends of the cells that are closer to your bloodstream are specialized for transporting those nutrients into the blood. Similar asymmetries exist for many other cell types as well.

## Basics of Synaptic Transmission

- Key words: synapse, electrical synapse, chemical synapse
  - synaptic cleft
- Key questions:
  - What are the main components of an electrical / chemical synapse?
  - Where in the body can you find electrical / chemical synapses?
  - Which type of synapse relays information faster?
  - What is the direction of information transmission?
  - What type of molecules do chemical synapses release? Do all these molecules have the same effect on the postsynaptic neuron?
- hallmark
- **Electrical synapse**
  - Physical pores shared by two neurons allow ions to flow between the two.
  - Electrical synapses deliver signals faster than chemical synapses do.
  - This synapse type is used in reflex circuits.
  - The two connected neurons communicate bidirectionally.
  - This bidirectional communication enables multiple neurons to synchronize activity. The heart relies on this mechanism.
  - The brain, reflex circuites and heart have electrical synapses. 
  - Signal type: (only) Voltage.
- **Chemical synapse**
  - Diffusion is the way that chemicals arrive at another neuron.
  - Chemical synapses deliver signals faster than electrical synapses do.
  - The two connected neurons communicate unidirectionally.
  - Signal type: Diverse chemincals
  - Different chemicals lead to postsynapses' different reactions (e.g., excitation, inhibition).
  - The arrival of an action potential at the chemical synapse doesn't guarantee you that a spike will occur in the postsynaptic cell.
- Upstream neuron: Pre-synaptic neuron
- Downstream neuron: Post-synaptic neuron
- Synaptic cleft: Size 20-40 nm. 1000 times thinner than human hair.

## Anatomy of the Synapse

- Key words: chemical synapse, presynaptic terminal, postsynaptic terminal, synaptic cleft, vesicle, ionotropic receptor, metabotropic receptor
- Key questions:
  - What is the synaptic cleft? How large is it? Is it empty?
  - What is a vesicle? What is a receptor? Where in a synapse can you usually find the vesicles / receptors?
  - What are the main steps of synaptic transmission?
  - What are the two major categories of receptors? What makes them different?
- Chemical synapse
  - is unidirectional communication.
- Dendrite
  - is where a neuron receives signals from other neurons.
  - contains postsynaptic terminals.
- Axon
  - is where a neuron sends signals from other neurons.
  - contains presynaptic terminals.
- Postsynaptic terminal
  - is part of a dendrite.
  - releases neurotransmitters to the synaptic cleft.
  - has vesciles that contain neurotransmitters.
- Presynaptic terminal
  - is part of an axon.
- Vesicle
  - is made up of lipid bilayers.
- Neurotransmitter
  - has its unique effect to postsynapses.
- Ionotropic receptor
  - is ligand-gated ion channels that open when a specific neurotransmitter binds.
- Metabotropic receptor
  - a type of membrane receptor that initiates a number of metabolic steps to modulate cell activity, such as G proteins.

## The Presynaptic Terminal

- Key words: exitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP), miniature EPSPs (mEPSPs), miniature IPSPs (mIPSPs), end plate potential (EPP), vesicle
- Key questions:
  - How is a neuromuscular junction different from a synapse?
  - What are EPSPs, IPSPs, EPPs, mEPSPs, and mEPPs? If you wanted to record these potentials, where in the neuromuscular junction would you stick your electrode?
  - When do mEPPs occur? Do they vary in amplitude?
  - How do drugs affect EPPs and mEPPs?
  - How does calcium change the amplitude of EPPs?
  - What key observation regarding the amplitude of mEEPs led Katz to formulate the quantum hypothesis?
- Here you'll learn more about the experiments that led Katz to imagine the quantum hypothesis.
- Neuromuscular junction (NMJ)
- Acetylcholine
  - How acetylcholine is processed plays an important role in modern anesthesia.
- Exitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP)
- Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP)
- End Plate Potential (EPP)
  - is the voltages which cause depolarization of skeletal muscle fibers caused by neurotransmitters binding to the postsynaptic membrane in the neuromuscular junction.
- Miniature EPSPs (mEPSPs)
- Miniature IPSPs (mIPSPs)
- Miniature EPP (mEPP)
  - EPP caused by the random release of single quanta of neurotransmitter from a resting presynaptic terminal.
- Curare 
  - blocks acetylcholine receptors and prevents acetylcholine from activating the postsynaptic receptors.
  - causes paralysis.
- Neostigmine 
  - blocks the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme which breaks down acetylcholine. Thus, it allows a given dose of acetylcholine to have a stronger effect.
  - makes the EPPs increase in amplitude and duration.
- The roles of Ca2++
  - EPP is proportional to [Ca2+]^4.
  - Voltage-gated channels open by the presynaptic depolarization, which allows calcium to flow in. Then available intracellular calcium allows the release of neurotransmitter.
  - **Ca2++ outside -> Postsynaptic depolarization -> Ca2++ inside -> neurotransmitters are released**
- **Mini EPP**
  - The mini EPPs represented the release of just **one** of these putative packages of neurotransmitter. Neurotransmitter release in synaptic transmission is a quantized process.
  - At low intracellular calcium levels, one can see this quantization because the probability of neurotransmitter is so low that a few mini EPPs do not sum together.
  - At higher intracellular calcium levels, as under normal physiologic conditions, the nature of large numbers tends to obscure the quantization, since the histogram becomes more and more smeared out.

## Visualizing the Synapse

## Lesson 1 Conclusion

In the late 19th century, Italian physiologist Camillo Golgi invented a revolutionary neuron **staining technique** called the "black reaction" (or Golgi method). For the first time ever, it became possible to **visualize** individual neurons with their branches under a **microscope**. From his observations, Golgi proposed the reticular theory: all the cells of the brain are physically connected together through their branches such that they form one continuous network.

At the same time, Spanish physiologist Santiago Ramón y Cajal improved the Golgi method. Based on his observations, and in opposition to the reticular theory, Ramón y Cajal proposed the neuron theory: each cell of the brain has its own set of branches, which means information through the brain has to jump from one neuron to the next.

While Ramón y Cajal hypothesized the existence of what we know today as the **synapse** in the late 19th century, the first proof of such structures came in 1950's, with the invention of **electron microscopy**. Since then, synapses have been studied in great detail - as you've learned through this lesson.

Synapses come in two flavors: electrical and chemical, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. Unlike their electrical relatives, **chemical synapses** transmit information **unidirectionally**, a consequence of their polarised structure: information goes from the pre- to the postsynaptic cell through the synaptic cleft. More precisely, in order to cross the synaptic cleft, information is converted from frequencies of electrical pulses to concentrations of neurotransmitter released at the presynaptic site. In the coming lesson, we'll see how this chemical information is converted back into electrical signals at the postsynaptic site.
