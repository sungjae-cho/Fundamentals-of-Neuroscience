## Voltage

- Key questions
  - How do same and opposite charges interact?
  - What is voltage? How is voltage related to electrical potential?
- Current = the rate of charge flow
- Voltage = the difference in electrical potential between two points
  - Measured in volts (V).
  - The electrical potential helps us describe the strength and direction of the forces that motivate electrical charge flow, based on electrostatic forces between charged objects.
- Attraction (attract) and replsion (repel)
- Ions cannot flow across this membrane without the help of channels or pumps.
- Ions can move through membrane channels and form a charge difference between these two compartments, resulting in a potential (or voltage) across the membrane. The impermeability of the membrane allows this voltage to be maintained.
- Voltage is a relative measurement.
- Neuroscientists always use the outside of the cell as the ‘ground’ or reference point to measure the voltage across the membrane.

## Introducing the Resting Potential

- Key questions:
  - What are the main parts of a neuron?
    - Soma, axon, dendrite, lipid bilayer, cell membrane, 
  - What is a 'membrane potential'? How can you measure it?
    - (membrane potential) = (intracellular voltage) - (extracellular ground)
  - What are the most important ions that affect a neuron’s membrane potential?
    - The charged ions of sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and chloride (Cl-). 
- Membrane potential: this is a general term that describes the voltage across the membrane at any point in time; the membrane potential of a neuron can vary widely, for example from -90 mV to +60 mV.
- Resting potential: the membrane potential of a neuron that is specifically "at rest," meaning that it is not sending or receiving signals, generally between -60 mV and -70 mV.

## Diffusion and Electrostatics

- Key questions
  - What are diffusive and electrostatic forces?
  - How can these forces affect the movement of an ion across a neuron’s membrane?
- Diffusive force: From high to low concentration. 
- Dlectrostatic force: (+) -> (-); (-) -> (+)

## Potentials and Equilibrium

- Key questions
  - How would the membrane potential change if K+ ions are allowed to flow out of the cell, or into the cell?
  - How are diffusive and electrostatic forces related to each other?
  - When is equilibrium reached for the flow of charged ions?
- Only a tiny proportion of ions move relative to the total number of ions inside and outside the cell.

## The Nernst Potential

- Key questions
  - How do temperature and valence affect the Nernst Potential?
  - Do the absolute or the relative concentrations of ions matter in determining the Nernst Potential? How do changes to the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of K+ affect its Nernst Potential?
  - What is "driving force," and how do we calculate it?
- Nernst Potential: the membrane potential at which the diffusion and electrostatic forces for an ion balance out, given particular concentrations inside and outside of the cell.
  - Nernst potential = reversal potential = equilibrium potential
  - Nernst potential != resting potential (in a steady state)
  - The Nernst potential is the aim or attractor of the ions themselves.

- Nerst equation
  - $`E_{\text{ion}}=\frac{RT}{zF}\ln{\frac{[\text{ion}]_{\text{out}}}{[\text{ion}]_{\text{in}}}}`$
    - $R$: The universal gas constant. Fixed.
    - $T$: The kalvin temperature of the solution. K = °C + 273.15.
    - $z$: The valence of the ion. (Na+: +1, Ca2+: +2, Cl-: -1)
    - $F$: Faraday's constant. Fixed.
    - $[\text{ion}]$: The ion concentration.
    - The unit of the result is voltage (V).

## The GHK Equation

- Key questions:
  - What is permeability, and how does it factor into the GHK equation?
  - How are the GHK equation and the equation for the Nernst potential related?
  - For a regular neuron, which ions are most and least permeable?
- The GHK equation lets us compute the resting potential, which is the result of multiple ions' equilibrium.
- Steady state
  - At a steady state, no single ion will be at its own equilibrium, but the total net flow of all charges into and out of the cell will be equal and opposite.
  - resting pontential $\subset$ steady state
- The GHK equation: See the [formula sheet](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/f2608d87124ed611d0e711451bbd8240/asset-v1:HarvardX+MCB80.1x+2T2023+type@asset+block/Formula_sheet.pdf).
- -55mV: Threshold potential/voltage, where action pontentials are generated.
- Driving force = V_{membrane} - E_{ion}
- The sodium's sensitivity is the key to how neurons communicate with each other.
- Hyperpolarization vs. Depolarization
  - Hyperpolarization: More (negatively) polarized.
  - Depolarization: Less (negatively) polarized.
    - = hypopolarization

## Ion Filters

- Key questions:
  - What is a 'solvation shell'?
  - How are Na+ ions excluded from K+ selective ion channels?
- How the selectivity is implemented
  - Size (radius)
    - Na+: 116pm
    - K+: 152pm
- Na+ (cation): Surrounded by water molecules. This surrounding is called a solvation shell.
- Channels are made up of proteins.
- Though the sizes are similar, the charges are different. The carboxyl groups inside the K+ leak channel have a negative dipole facing the inside of the channel. This negative charge would repel Br- ions.

## The Sodium/Potassium Pump

- Key questions:
  - What is the role of the Na+/K+ pump in neurons?
  - What would happen to a neuron if the Na+/K+ pump were damaged?
- Channels
  - Passive K+ selective channels
  - Passive Na+ selective channels
- Na+/K+ pump
  - 2Na+ out, 1K+ in
  - It consumes ATP.
- The transport of sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell is so important to neuronal function
- This function consumes up to 70% of the ATP required for overall brain function.
- The dysfunction of the Na+/K+ pump
  - The neuron will no longer be able to function properly.
  - The resting potential of the neuron will change.
  - Both Na+ and K+ ion concentrations will be affected.

## Lesson 1: Conclusion

So far our main objective has been to understand how the resting potential is established. A defining feature of neurons is that they use electrical signalling so communicate and allow the nervous system to function. Neurons themselves have a voltage across their membranes, which is a difference in electrical potential that we measure from the inside with respect to the outside.

These voltage differences are the result of the movement of ions. Neurons sit in a solution that contains particular concentrations of certain ions, and these same ions have particular concentrations inside the neurons themselves. Two separate forces guide the movement of ions across the membrane: diffusion and electrostatic force. Ions move through channels in the membrane, and, depending on the proteins in the neuronal membrane, different ions are able to pass through the membrane more or less easily. We call these different permeabilities.

Using certain equations, we can calculate the electrical potential across a membrane. For the movement of a single ion, we can use the Nernst equation to determine the equilibrium potential under which diffusion and electrostatic force are balanced, and we can use the GHK equation to calculate the resting potential when many ions are involved. The maintenance of the resting potential is very important for neurons - there are pumps such as the sodium/potassium ATPase that consume immense amounts of energy to keep ions at particular concentrations, ensuring that the neurons are able to function properly.
