# 1-6 Final Exam

Record what I have learned from the exam.

- Permiability: K+ > Cl- > Na+ > Ca2+
- Permiability of an ion type changes the resting potential but does not the Nernst/equilibrium potential.
- The Nernst equation does not consider permiability but the GHK equation does.
- The role of the Na+/K+ pump is to move K+ into the cell and Na+ out of the cell. This maintains the Na+ and K+ ions' concentration gradients. Theese gradients is vital for proper neuron functioning.
- The membrane surface decreases. -> The membrane capacitance decreases. -> The time constant of the memebrane decreases. -> The ion channels react faster.
  - The membrane is a round capacitor.
- "Membrane capacitance has no effect on the length constant."
  - Memrane capacitance affects the speed of the membrane current but does not the length constant itself.
- Very few ions are required to cross the membrane in order to have large effects on the action potential.
- During the absolute refractory period, the voltage-gated Na+ channels are inactivated and so no amount of added current can initiate another action potential.
- Lacking the Na+/K+ pump, the cell is unable to restore the ion gradients and as more action potentials are fired and time continues, the membrane approaches equilibrium at 0 mV.
- **Antidromic stimulation**
  - If the neuron does project to this region, the researcher is placing a stimulating electrode near the axon and then recording voltage changes at the soma of this neuron.
    - The soma is the place to record the neuron's potential.
  - One issue with antidromic stimulation is that this stimulation can activate nearby neurons that may be driving our recording measurements.
  - **Collision test**
    1. Stimulate the axon.
    1. Right after the somatic activity occurs, stimulate the soma.
    1. Confirmation
      - The somatic activity exists. -> The axon belongs to another neuron.
      - The somatic activity disappears. -> The axon is the part of the soma's neuron.
- The passive spread of charge along the completely myelinated axon will dissipate and so the depolarization will attenuate. Unmyelinated axons propagte action potentials better than fully myelinated ones.
- If Cl- channels are mostly open, the neuron is being 'held' at the resting potential. This would tend to prevent threshold from being reached. In real life, **opening Cl- channels** is a common mechanism for **inhibiting a neuron**, or preventing it from firing action potentials.
- Similarly, leak K+ current opposes the flow of Na+ into the cell during the rising phase. So, if the driving force of this K+ current is lower then the rising phase should be faster.
- when the Nernst potential of K+ is more positive, we expect both the resting potential to be more positive, and then it will be easier for a part of the membrane to reach threshold and fire an action potential.
- Na+ channel activation is fast while its inactivation is slow. K+ channel activation is slow.
- If there is a very fast-activated K+ channel, the influx of this current will at first prevent the neuron from reaching threshold, and so lead to the delay observed.
